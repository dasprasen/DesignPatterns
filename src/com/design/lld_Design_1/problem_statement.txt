Problem Statement-

Question 1 -> Design OOPs for Amazon Alexa devices. Echo Show, Echo Dot and, Amazon Echo.
These devices have different input(typing, voice), output(sound, display) and power(battery, plug-in) mode.
Your Design should be able to handle different input & must respond with the correct output when Alexa is asked about its battery status(i.e X% charged or plugged-in).

Question 2 -> 2 types of devices: Echo dot type (without a screen) and iPad type (with a screen).
Furthermore, they may be either battery operated and/or plug-in power operated. Design a way to display/announce the battery status message based on the device type.
If non-battery operated, display/announce that they are directly plugged-in.
