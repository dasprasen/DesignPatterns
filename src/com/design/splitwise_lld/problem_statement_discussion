Design Split wise:

Requirements:
1. Do we need to support different types of expense splits (equal, exact, percentage) ?
2. Should we handle group expense as well as individual expense ?
3. Do we need to support multiple currencies ?
4. Should we implement features like simplify debt or just track who owes whom ?
5. Is persistence required or just in-memory operations ?


Based on typical expectations, focus on:

1. User registration and management
2. Creating groups
3. Adding expenses (equal split for simplicity)
4. Tracking balances
5. Settling up between users
